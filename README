# Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper game implemented using C++ and Qt. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) where players can reveal cells, flag potential mines, and try to clear the board without hitting any mines.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: The game uses Qt for the GUI, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.
- **Random Mine Placement**: Mines are placed randomly on the board at the start of each game.
- **Hints**: Each cell displays the number of adjacent mines, helping players make informed decisions.
- **Flagging and Question Marks**: Players can flag cells they suspect contain mines and use question marks for uncertain cells.
- **Win/Loss Detection**: The game detects when a player hits a mine (loss) or successfully clears the board without hitting any mines (win).
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game to start a new round.

- `cell.h` and `cell.cpp`: Define and implement the `Cell` class, which represents individual cells on the game board.
- `resources.qrc`: Contains references to the icons used in the game.
- `Makefile`: Generated by qmake, used to build the project.
- `minesweep.pro`: Qt project file, specifies the source files, headers, and resources for the project.
- `README`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for building and running the game.

## Building and Running the Game

# How to Play
1. Reveal Cells: Left-click on a cell to reveal it. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If it does not, it will display the number of adjacent mines.
2. Flag Mines: Right-click on a cell to cycle through flagging it as a potential mine, marking it with a question mark, or clearing the mark.
3. Win the Game: Reveal all cells that do not contain mines to win the game.
