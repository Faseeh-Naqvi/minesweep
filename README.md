## Overview
Minesweeper challenges players to clear a grid without detonating hidden mines. Each safe cell reveals a number indicating how many mines lie in the adjacent cells (from 1 to 8), which helps players deduce safe areas. This implementation uses C++ and Qt to provide a responsive and visually appealing experience with random mine placement, intuitive cell marking, and instant win/loss detection.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developed with Qt, delivering an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
- **Random Mine Placement:** Mines are randomly distributed at the start of each game, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
- **Accurate Hints:** Revealed cells display numbers (1â€“8) indicating the count of adjacent mines.
- **Cell Marking:** Right-click a cell to cycle through markings (flag, question mark, or clear), helping you track suspected mines.
- **Win/Loss Detection:** Immediate feedback when a mine is triggered or when all safe cells are revealed.
- **Reset Functionality:** Easily restart the game with a new board configuration.

## File Structure
- **main.cpp**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the Qt application and displays the main window.
- **MainWindow.h / MainWindow.cpp**: Define and implement the main window, managing the game board and user interactions.
- **board.h / board.cpp**: Implement the `Board` class, which handles game logic such as mine placement, cell revealing, and win/loss conditions.
- **cell.h / cell.cpp**: Define the `Cell` class that represents individual cells on the game board.
- **resources.qrc**: Contains references to the icons used (mines, flags, question marks, etc.).
- **minesweep.pro**: Qt project file, specifying the source files, headers, and resources.
- **Makefile**: Generated by qmake; used for building the project.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for building and running the game.
